1.9.17 (2015-10-01)

	* init.(c)sh: Add support for /opt/X11 as preferred x11 prefix
          for PATH and MANPATH, with /usr/X11 as fallback (scrap
          /usr/X11R6, which was previously *only* supported prefix).
	* init.(c)sh: Scrap special settings for 10.4 and earlier

1.9.16 (2014-11-13)

1.9.14 (2013-02-05)

	* Some versions of sh-type shells don't grok '=~', so use a more widely compatible
	  syntax.
	
1.9.13 (2013-01-09)

	* init.(c)sh: Don't put /usr/X11R6/bin in the PATH if some "X11*bin" is already 
	  present there, since the X11 distros on 10.5+ set the PATH up appropriately already
	  by default.
	* add podfiles stub for perl 5.12.4 (10.8 system-perl)	  
	* Added a NEWS file which summarizes the changes in each release.

	* revert previous change: VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT now being handled
	  within fink

1.9.9 (2009-03-16)

	* update copyright notice

	* minor revision to buildsystem
	* add BASEPATH/lib/perl5/$perlversion/man to the MANPATH
	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: factor out common code from then/else

1.9.5 (2004-12-20)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Moved profile.d reading to after setting of
	  HTTP/FTP-proxy env vars.
	* init.csh.in: Added "validate" to the completions for "fink".

1.9.4 (2004-11-08)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: bugfix for when /usr/local/man does not exist

1.9.3 (2004-11-02)

	there

1.9.2 (2004-08-10)

	* Include "." (default when unset) when explicitly setting CLASSPATH
	  (bug #1005793)

	* init.sh.in: Fixed zsh compatibility (patch #915657)
	* updated copyright notice
	* VERSION: use 1.9.0.cvs to match build system
	* inject.pl: update to the new style, which relies on Bootstrap.pm
	* README.buildsystem: documenting fink's build system

1.9.0 (2003-12-06)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Add $basepath/lib/perl5/darwin to PERL5LIB
	  (needed so that Apple's perl 5.8.1 with the darwin-thread-multi-2level arch
	  flag will find files from -pm packages).

	* inject.pl, base-files.info.in: Add MD5sum.

	* inject.pl: update syntax to "use 5.006" (from "use v5.6.0")

	* base-files.info.in: Change Maintainer.

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Fix permissions tests for profile.d scripts. Add
	  -r because they are loaded using a read process. Keep -x to allow
	  profile.d to contain non-loading (README, etc.) files by installing them
	  chmod 644 (part of my patch #815900).
	* init.csh.in: Fix command-completion for 'fink' to match those listed by
	  'fink --help' (part of bug #829520). Move the code that sets
	  command-completion to before the code that loads profile.d to allow a fink
	  package to override with an alternate completion (part of Feature Requests
	  #829533).

1.8.0 (2003-04-28)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Use /usr/bin/manpath to set the original value of
	  MANPATH when it is not already set (bug #642692)

	* init.sh: Fix zsh path code (bug #721603), as suggested by jinschoi.

1.7 (2003-04-14)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Patch #683277  by Remi Mommsen which allows them
	  to be loaded multiple times and still adds to the various PATH variables
	  only once (Feature Request #594676).

1.6 (2002-08-04)

	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Patch #588476 (Java support) by Sylvain Cuaz.
	* Updated copyright notice in all files.

1.5 (2002-01-11)

	* fink-release: Moved to the packages module, where it fits better.
	* inject.pl, install.sh: Don't install fink-release anymore.
	* init.csh.in, init.sh.in: Merged Justin Hallett's patch which sets proxy
	  related environment variables based on BASEPATH/etc/fink.conf.
	* init.csh.in: Added auto-complete for tcsh.
